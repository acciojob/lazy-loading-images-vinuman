# Lazy Loading Images

## Insturctions

You are building a web page that contains a large number of images. To improve the page's performance, you decide to implement lazy loading of images so that they only load when they are in the viewport. Write a JavaScript function that detects when an image is in the viewport and asynchronously loads it.

## Acceptance criteria:

Image should load when its in viewport.
